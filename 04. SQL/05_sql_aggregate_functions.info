05. Aggregate functions operate on values across rows to perform mathematical calculations such as sum, average, counting, 
and minimum/maximum values, as well as some non-mathematical operations. 
    
Most common aggregate functions.  
    AVG
        Returns the average of non-NULL records. If all records inside a group are NULL, the function returns NULL.
    COUNT 
        Returns either the number of non-NULL records for the specified columns, or the total number of records.
    MAX
        Returns the maximum value for the records within ,<expr>. NULL values are ignored unless all the records are NULL, 
        in which case a NULL value is returned.
    MIN
        Returns the minimum value for the records within <expr>. NULL values are ignored unless all the records are NULL, 
        in which case a NULL value is returned.
    SUM
        Returns the sum of non-NULL records for <expr>. You can use the DISTINCT keyword to compute the sum of unique non-null values. 
        If all records inside a group are NULL, the function returns NULL.
