# 04. Initials
# # Comments
# Comments are very important in programming because they are used to document what our code does. They are also used to disable parts of the program.

# When the program is run, the comments are ignored.

# In Python, we can create a comment using the # hashtag symbol:

# # Printing out a message 
# print('Hi')

# On the first line, we created a comment. As a result, everything to the right of the hashtag # is ignored. The program continues to the next line, and the output is simply:

# Hi

# Python only ignores anything after the # on a line. So when a comment is placed towards the end of a line like this:

# print('Hi')   # I'm a comment, too!

# Here, the output will still be "Hi" because any code before the comment on the same line is still executed.

# Instructions
# Create an initials.py program that displays your initials in block letters.

# First, start the program with a comment that says a fun fact about yourself.

# Then, create your block letters with your initials.

# For example, if your name is Dua Lipa, your initials would be D and L, and your block letters would look like this:

# DDDD   L
# D   D  L
# D   D  L
# D   D  L
# D   D  L
# D   D  L
# DDDD   LLLLL

print("       J   M          M")
print("       J   MM        MM")
print("       J   M M      M M")
print("       J   M  M    M  M")
print("       J   M   M  M   M")
print("J     J    M    M     M")
print(" J   J     M          M")
print("  JJJ      M          M")
