# 03. Pattern
# # Line by Line
# Python is run one line at a time, from top to bottom.

# We can output multiple messages by using multiple print() functions. For example, if we want to print out two simple greetings:

# print('🌻 Morning Dharma!')
# print('🙋🏽 Evening Sonny!')

# This will output:

# 🌻 Morning Dharma!
# 🙋🏽 Evening Sonny!

# Now let's use what we just learned to complete a special challenge! ⋆˙⟡

# Instructions
# Suppose we want the output to look exactly like this pattern below:

#        1
#      2 3
#    4 5 6
# 7 8 9 10

# How can you do that?

# Create a pattern.py program that prints this pattern exactly as shown.

# This will likely take some trial and error, but give it a shot!

print("       1")
print("     2 3")
print("   4 5 6")
print("7 8 9 10")
